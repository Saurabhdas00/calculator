# React Calculator 🧮

Welcome to the *one calculator to rule them all*! (Or at least to add, subtract, multiply, and divide…) 😄

---

## Why This Exists 🤔  
Everyone who starts their journey in development has to create **The Calculator™** – it’s practically a rite of passage! This is my version of stepping into the React world by crafting my very own calculator. Why? Because numbers deserve React components too. 😉

---

## Features ✨
- **Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide**: Classic operations, no frills – just math.
- **Result Display**: Gives you instant answers (because waiting is so last century).
- **Clear Button**: Wipes away your mistakes (but not your regrets from last night).
- **Error Handling**: Division by zero? Not on my watch! You'll get a polite "Error."

## How to Use 🕹️  
1. Clone the repo (you already knew that, didn’t you?).  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-calculator.git
   cd react-calculator
